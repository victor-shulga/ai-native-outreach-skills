# ICP Builder

Build a structured ICP definition from existing knowledge, call recordings, and win/loss data. Output a reusable ICP file that all other skills can reference.

## What you need

- Any of the following (provide as much as you have):
  - Description of your best current customers
  - Sales call recordings or transcripts
  - Win/loss notes
  - Industry intuition about who benefits most
- What problem you solve and for whom

## Process

1. Ask 8 calibration questions if inputs are thin:
   - Who are your 3 best customers right now — what do they have in common?
   - Who do you lose deals to most often, and why?
   - What does the prospect say in the first call that makes you think "this is perfect"?
   - What's the typical team size/structure that gets value fastest?
   - What signals tell you a company needs you right now vs. in 6 months?
   - What roles are involved in the buying decision?
   - What is the one sentence your best customer would use to describe your value?
   - What type of company is a waste of time, even if they match on paper?
2. Synthesize answers into structured ICP dimensions
3. Add negative ICP criteria (disqualifiers)
4. Output as a reusable markdown ICP file

## Output format

```
# ICP Definition: [Company Name]
Last updated: [date]

## Firmographic fit
- Industry: [list]
- Company size: [headcount range]
- Revenue stage: [e.g., Series A–C / $5M–$50M ARR]
- Geography: [list]
- Business model: [B2B SaaS / Agency / Services / etc.]

## Technographic fit
- Uses: [tools that indicate fit]
- Likely stack: [CRM, outbound tools, etc.]

## Persona fit
- Primary: [role] — [why this person buys]
- Secondary: [role] — [influence/blocker context]

## Situational fit (when they need you NOW)
- [Signal 1]
- [Signal 2]
- [Signal 3]

## Negative ICP (disqualifiers)
- [Company type or situation to skip]
- [Characteristic that predicts churn or no-close]

## One-sentence value for this ICP
"[What you do] for [who] so they can [outcome]."
```

## Notes

- This file is the input to icp-validation, signal-research, hypothesis-builder, and sequence-writer
- Revisit after every 20 closed deals — ICPs drift
- Negative ICP criteria are as important as positive ones — include them
- If call recordings are available, extract language the prospect used and include it verbatim under situational fit
